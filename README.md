# PIRA-biomass-functions
Allometric equations for \textit{P. radiata} trees in Chile, ensuring compatibility between the expected values for each component, but also between equation errors, allowing for uncertainty estimation of biomass and carbon capture on pine plantations.

This code is part of our under-revision manuscript "Modeling above-ground biomass in \textit{Pinus radiata} trees with explicit multivariate uncertainty" by Sandoval, S; Montes, CR; Mena-Quijada, P; Acu√±a, E; Olmedo GF. Submitted to Forestry.
